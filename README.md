```

## Description

This application uses the following libraries:

- Vite as the React framework
- Bootstrap for the CSS framework
- Luxon for working with JS dates
- React-datepicker for out-of-the-box datepicker component

## Notes

There are minimal error handling implemented in the application.
API calls are mostly assumed to be successful.

Error handling discussions are points in improvement, both in this application and the requirements documentation, i.e. what error scenarios to handle, what error messages and screens to transition to.
